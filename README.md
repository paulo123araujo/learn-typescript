### Comments

> Here i'll comment something that i see while learn typescript

- An advantage to use typescript is to write code in newer version of ecma script and transpile to a version that works on olds browsers
- For what I see, Typescript is a easy way to import (i don't know if this is the best word to use) the before knowledge to javascript (Classes, Interfaces, object oriented, design patterns).
- Typescript solve the types during the development while javascript is during the runtime.
